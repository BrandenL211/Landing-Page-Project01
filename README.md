## Project Infomation
This is the 2nd project in the Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree program.
In this project we have made a Landing Page. This is the first project that we are using HTML, CSS, and Javascript together. In this project I created a navigation bar to be created dynamically when the browser starts. Also I have a scrolling listener to make it clear what section we are in by showing circles around the text of that section. Also we can see what section we are in from the navigation bar at the top because it is highlghting what section we are currently in.
